h1. Rack::UniversalAnalytics

Going to steal most of this from https://github.com/kangguru/rack-google-analytics.
Would continue to use the rack-google-analytics gem but have multi-tenint CMS where
I need to mix and depricate sites slowly off of the ga.js and gpt.js retargeting 
scripts.

h2. Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'rack-universal_analytics'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rack-universal_analytics
